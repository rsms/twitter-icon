# White Twitter icon

This is an alternative icon to the three different (but ugly) alternatives which comes with Twitter.app.

## Installing

1. Bring up the context menu of Twitter.app and select "Show Package Contents"
2. Navigate to Contents/Resources
3. Find Icon.icns, select it and "Get Info" (Cmd+i)
4. Click the tiny orange lock in the bottom right corner of the info window to unlock the file
5. Under "Sharing & Permissions", select "Read & Write" for the "everyone" name
6. Rename the file to Icon-original.icns
7. Drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste the white [Icon.icns file from this project](https://github.com/rsms/twitter-icon/raw/master/Icon.icns) into the Resources directory

Next time you start Twitter.app it should look like this:
